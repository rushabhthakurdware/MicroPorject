# MicroPorject
This is a Student Enrollment Form created using Html and JavaScript on netbeans using a JSONPowerDB Database management system
The project contains the following features :
1. Form Validation: Ensure that users can't submit the form with incomplete or invalid data. For instance, you can check that the roll number, name, and other fields are filled out correctly before submission.


2. Success/Error Messages: After the user submits the form, you could show success or error messages to improve the user experience. This helps in confirming that the data was stored or notifying them of any issues.


3. Data Editing: You could add functionality where users can edit their details by entering their roll number, making it easier to keep the information updated.

  
4. Search Feature: If you want to expand on the "view details" part, you could add a search feature where users can search by name or other criteria in addition to the roll number.
